#### variables (and good names) - What kind of comment is this?
# create a string variable
name = "bill"
# create an integer variable
age = 10
# create a float variable
age = 10.



print(name,age)
#### input
# get input from the user and store it in a variable
age = input("what is your age?")

# get a number from the user (decide if you want to convert now or later)
# age = int(age)

# print (age*3)

#### output and f-strings
# output all the variables with a single print statement
print("Hello" + name + "! Your age is "+ age + ".")
# now use an f-string to output all the variables


# output all the variables again, but use a string method on one 
# so that it prints in upper case, lower case, or title case
